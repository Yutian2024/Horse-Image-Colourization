# Horse Image Colourization
A Jupyter Notebook for colourizing grey scale horse images with the help of GAN.  
Models are trained on CIFAR dataset.  
Due to large sum of images, the .ipynb file is zipped as 'Image_Colourization.rar'.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Convert RGB images to grayscale and prepare paired datasets.
- **Model Architecture**: cGAN-based encoder-decoder for mapping grayscale to RGB channels.
- **Training**: Train on image datasets to learn realistic colour mapping.
- **Testing**: Apply trained model to unseen grayscale images.

## Requirements
The notebook was written on Google Colab. To run it, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- scikit-image
- opencv-python
- jupyter
